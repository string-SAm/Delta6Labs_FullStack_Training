# My MERN and MEAN Stack Development Journey AT DELTA6LABS

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I'll be documenting my journey as I learn and explore the world of MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) stack development from scratch. Below, you'll find an overview of the topics covered and the projects I've worked on.

## Introduction

In this repository, I'll be sharing my experience learning and mastering the MERN and MEAN stacks. These stacks are popular choices for building modern web applications due to their flexibility, scalability, and ease of development. My journey will include learning key concepts, building projects, and gaining hands-on experience with each component of the stack.

## Technologies Used

During my journey, I'll be working with the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store application data.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used for building RESTful APIs and web servers.
- **React.js / Angular**: Front-end JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side programming.
- **HTML/CSS**: Fundamentals of web development for structuring and styling web pages.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The programming language used for client-side and server-side scripting.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I'll be working on to apply my MERN and MEAN stack knowledge:

1. **Project 1**: [P1](Link): Description:.
2. **Project 2**: [P2](Link): Description:.
3. **Project 3**: [P3](Link): Description:.

I'll update this list as I progress through my learning journey and complete new projects.

## Resources

Throughout my learning journey, I'll be using various resources such as online courses, tutorials, documentation, and community forums. Here are some of the resources I've found helpful:

- [Resource 1 Name](Link): Description of the resource.
- [Resource 2 Name](Link): Description of the resource.
- [Resource 3 Name](Link): Description of the resource.

I'll also document any additional resources I discover along the way.

## Acknowledgements

I want to express my gratitude to the Delta6Labs, training Instructor, and open-source community for providing valuable resources and support throughout my MERN and MEAN stack journey.
